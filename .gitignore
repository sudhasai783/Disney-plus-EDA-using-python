In my exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for Disney Plus, I undertook a comprehensive investigation of the dataset containing detailed information about various shows available on the platform. The first step involved examining the dataset's structure to understand its composition and the types of data it contained. This included key attributes such as show IDs, titles, directors, cast members, countries of origin, dates added, release years, ratings, durations, genres, and descriptions.

To ensure the integrity of the analysis, I addressed any missing values by identifying rows with null entries and opting to drop them from the dataset. This was crucial for maintaining the accuracy of the findings. I also checked for duplicate entries to eliminate any redundancy, further ensuring the dataset's reliability. In addition to this, I explored the unique values present in each column, which helped me understand the diversity and distribution of the data, such as the number of distinct directors, countries, and genres.

Once I had cleaned and organized the data, I proceeded to create several visualizations to illustrate my findings effectively:

1. **Count of Movies by Rating**: I generated a count plot to show the distribution of movies across different ratings. This visualization highlighted which ratings were most common in the dataset, providing insights into the content quality and target audience.

2. **Duration of Movies by Rating**: A box plot was created to illustrate the relationship between movie ratings and their durations. This helped in understanding whether there is a correlation between how long a movie is and its rating, revealing potential trends in content length for different age groups or audience ratings.

3. **Top 10 Countries with Most Movies**: Using a bar plot, I displayed the countries that produced the highest number of movies. This visualization provided insights into the geographic diversity of content available on Disney Plus and could help identify trends in regional popularity.

4. **Distribution of Movie Release Years**: I utilized a histogram to visualize the frequency of movie releases over the years. This analysis allowed me to track trends in movie production and identify peak years for releases, which could correlate with Disney's strategic content decisions.

5. **Top 10 Movie Genres**: To explore the variety of content, I created a bar plot representing the most common genres within the dataset. This visualization showcased the genres that dominate the Disney Plus library, providing insights into viewer preferences and content strategy.

6. **Number of Movies Released Over Time**: Finally, I plotted a line graph to track the number of movies released each year. This visualization helped illustrate trends over time, indicating whether there has been an increase or decrease in production and how it aligns with Disney Plusâ€™s growth as a streaming service.

Through these analyses and visualizations, I gained valuable insights into the trends, patterns, and characteristics of the Disney Plus content library. This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also deepened my understanding of the streaming industry and content strategies employed by major platforms.
